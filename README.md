# YoutubeVideoAnalysis

The data modeling of the project is as follows:

The final clean dataset has the following columns:  
**(video_id, publishedAt, channel_Id, video_title, channel_Title, tags, categoryId, duration, definition, caption, licensedContent, madeForKids, viewCount, likeCount, commentCount, country, category_title, trending_date)**

For this project, Iâ€™m going with a STAR schema because itâ€™s simpler and way faster for analysis. Since Iâ€™ll be loading data regularly and mainly using it for dashboards and quick queries, STAR makes the most sense. Itâ€™s easy to work with, scales well, and fits the way I want to slice the data by things like country, category, or channel.

**Hereâ€™s the STAR schema Iâ€™m using:**

dim_channel - (channel_id, channel_title)
dim_category - (category_id, category_title)
dim_country - (country_id, country)
dim_video - (video_id, video_title, tags, duration, definition, caption, licensedContent, publishedAt)
fact_video_trending_metrics - (video_id, channel_id, category_id, trending_date, viewCount, likeCount, commentCount, country_id)

That said, if I wanted to normalize the data fully, I already thought through how that would look â€” went through 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF just to get a clear picture. So Iâ€™m keeping those notes here too, just in case I want to revisit it or share with someone who cares about normalization.

### 1NF:

In our case:
- Each row has **atomic values**.
- Each row represents a **single entity**.
- Talking about the **"tags"** column, I am treating it as **one whole entity**, not splitting it by commas. This is because it's only used for **text analysis** and a **visualization (e.g., word cloud)** on the dashboard.  
â†’ Hence, the table satisfies **1NF**.

---

### 2NF:

To satisfy 2NF, we need to **remove partial dependencies**, meaning that **no non-key column should depend on part of a composite key**.

In our case:
- The composite key is **(video_id, trending_date)**.
- The following attributes depend **only on `video_id`** and **not on `trending_date`**, so they are moved into separate tables:

  - `channel_id`, `channel_title` â†’ depend only on `video_id`.
  - `category_id`, `category_title` â†’ depend only on `video_id`.
  - `publishedAt`, `video_title`, `tags`, `duration`, `definition`, `caption`, `licensedContent`, `madeForKids` â†’ all depend on `video_id`.

- The remaining table with `video_id` and `trending_date` contains attributes that are specific to the **videoâ€™s status on a particular trending date**:
  - `viewCount`, `likeCount`, `commentCount`, and `country`.

ðŸ‘‰ **Note on `country`**:  
Although `country` might seem like a static property, in this dataset it represents the **region where the video was trending** on that specific date. Therefore, it depends on the **composite key (video_id, trending_date)** and rightfully stays in this table.

---

### So after 2NF, we have the following tables:

1. `(channel_id, channel_title)`  
2. `(category_id, category_title)`  
3. `(video_id, publishedAt, video_title, tags, duration, definition, caption, licensedContent, madeForKids, channel_id, category_id)`  
4. `(video_id, trending_date, viewCount, likeCount, commentCount, country)`

dim_channel - (channel_id, channel_title)
dim_category - (category_id, category_title)
dim_country - (country_id, country)
fact_video - (video_id, channel_id, category_id, trending_date, viewCount, likeCount, commentCount, country_id)
dim_video - (video_id, video_title, tags, duration, definition, caption, licensedContent, publishedAt)

---

### 3NF:

To satisfy 3NF, there should be **no transitive dependencies** â€” i.e., **non-key attributes** should not depend on **other non-key attributes**.

In our case:
- All non-key attributes directly depend on their respective **primary keys**.
- `channel_title` depends only on `channel_id`  
- `category_title` depends only on `category_id`  
- Other columns like `video_title`, `tags`, `publishedAt`, etc. depend directly on `video_id`.
- Columns like  `trending_date`, `viewCount`, etc. depend on `(video_id, trending_date)`.
â†’ No transitive dependencies exist.

âœ… Hence, the schema satisfies **3NF**.

---

### BCNF:

BCNF is a stronger version of 3NF, which requires that **every determinant is a candidate key**.

In our case:
- All functional dependencies have **candidate keys** as determinants:
  - `channel_id â†’ channel_title`
  - `category_id â†’ category_title`
  - `video_id â†’ publishedAt, video_title, ...`
  - `(video_id, trending_date) â†’ viewCount, likeCount, ...`

âœ… All dependencies meet the condition â†’ Schema is in **BCNF**.
